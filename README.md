  Project - ft_printf
</h1>

The goal of this project is to recreate the printf() function in C, focusing on implementing a variadic function called ft_printf(). This project will enhance programming skills and requires a well-structured, extensible codebase. Participants will handle specific format conversions and must adhere to strict coding norms to avoid errors. Successfully completing the project will allow students to integrate ft_printf() into their libft for future assignments. The project includes mandatory and bonus components, with evaluation based on functionality and compliance with guidelines.
